AI Economics: The Time Traveler’s Gift
How Artificial Intelligence Accelerates Human Progress by Collapsing the Distance Between Present Effort and Future Abundance

Thomas Sowell described economics as “the study of how decisions affect the allocation of scarce resources in a way that raises or lowers the material standard of living of the people as a whole.” So, we want to know how AI will impact the standard of living for us all.

Artificial intelligence can be understood as a kind of time travel. Imagine there were no AI, only human progress unfolding naturally over the next fifty years. AI is a time machine that lets us reach into that future and bring its benefits into the present. Through intelligence efficiency (computers that think faster, longer, and better), we leapfrog decades of regular innovation cycles. This assumes the existence of reliable, highly capable AI, which now seems imminent.

AI time travel manifests as production efficiency, what Sowell called “the rate at which inputs are turned into outputs.”

1. AI raises the production of goods and services
AI increases the total output of goods and services by vastly improving the efficiency of knowledge work. This new abundance cascades through every domain.

In software, AI accelerates development, producing more and often better applications. Better software improves information quality and decision-making, thereby increasing productivity across the economy.

In science, AI accelerates breakthroughs in materials, energy, and biology, creating new goods, new industries, and new forms of value.

Each improvement compounds into the following, amplifying global output through recursive efficiency.

2. Efficiency lowers the cost of goods and services
As productivity accelerates, prices fall.

A flat-screen TV cost around $3,000 in 2000. Today, the same quality costs roughly $200–$300, a 10X reduction.

Accounting for inflation since the 1960s, the real cost of TVs has dropped by more than 99%. What was once luxury has become commonplace.

AI will replicate this pattern across domains — expert knowledge, design, education, and medicine — moving from scarcity to abundance.

3. Efficiency expands the supply frontier
AI’s compounding effects extend beyond cost reduction to new creation. Accelerated discovery and design mean new products, new services, and entirely new categories of human experience. Efficiency doesn’t merely optimize production—it expands the frontier of what can be produced at all.

4. Labor value deflates as knowledge work is automated
As more cognitive tasks are automated, the marginal value of human labor in traditional knowledge work declines. Two broad outcomes follow:

Outcome Reallocation: Workers shift toward the “Outcome Economy,” focusing on goals and results rather than effort or time. Human creativity, judgment, and ethics remain valuable where outcomes require meaning or trust.

Redistribution Mechanisms: Societies deploy capital redistribution systems (universal income, equity in compute infrastructure, or similar) to sustain human dignity and enable transition as abundance spreads globally.

5. Meaning becomes the new scarce resource
As material scarcity fades, psychological scarcity rises. Wealth and comfort will be abundant, but purpose and belonging will not. The next significant allocation problem (perhaps the final economic problem) will be how to allocate meaning.

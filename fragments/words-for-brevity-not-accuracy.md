# Words for Brevity, Not Accuracy

*On nomenclature, status signaling, and plain language*

I think your reasoning is mostly correct, but the conclusion (words for accuracy) is unsound. The reason for this is the nature of people.

With few exceptions, a large word can be substituted with numerous simpler, more common words.

## The Rationale

- A **word** is a collection of ideas.
- A **term** is a word that takes on additional ideas from context.
- **Nomenclature** acts as a utility function (tool) where the function is an encapsulation of ideas (aka shortcut).
- The only words I can think of that have no context mutation (ideas added through context) are dictionary words because they are isolated.

**Therefore:** since nomenclature may be decomposed (as nearly all words can be), words are not a means for accuracy, but rather a means for **brevity**.

## The Purpose of Words

The purpose of words is to convey ideas to others.

The purpose of conveying ideas is to communicate.

This communication may serve several purposes which impacts our word choices. For example, words may be used to:

- Signal intelligence
- Gatekeep
- Convenience
- Share ideas
- etc.

## Know Your Audience

If you are using nomenclature with an audience that does not have a shared understanding of your words, you may need to examine your purpose for communicating.

For example, I write posts with big words, but I do not expect most people to understand what I am talking about. Generally, I am writing out my original thoughts on a subject that are only meant for those who already share my nomenclature. In these cases, I wish to speak with people who have already put in the work to understand my starting position.

Alternatively, when I am speaking with my teens I use different words to share the same ideas. It takes longer, but is always rewarding.

## Status Signaling

It's unfortunate that our society is obsessed with status signaling. If it were otherwise, I believe we'd see fewer big words with such regularity.

## Plain Language Works

As a last example, **Donella Meadows** managed to write one hell of a book without using esoteric words in her fantastic book *Thinking in Systems*.

There are many examples of works where exceptional concepts are conveyed in plain language to be understood by plain people.

## The Question

Does God exist? Which God is right?

## The Debate

During our last ACX Meet-up, our table was discussing what one member believed was evidence for god.

During the debate, another gentleman asked us both: **what would it take for us to change our positions?**

I gave a reluctant answer with enough uncertainty that it has sat with me until now.

I believe what the second gentleman was getting at is the idea of **falsifiability**. I believe he was attempting to create a situation where the other gentleman might acknowledge his position was immovable and not reliant on the scientific arguments he was bringing forward.

> "In so far as a scientific statement speaks about reality, it must be falsifiable; and in so far as it is not falsifiable, it does not speak about reality."
> — Karl Popper

## My Better Answer

I'm incapable of affirming or denying the existence of god, let alone a specialized definition of it.

I've been reflecting on the implications of **Gödel's Incompleteness Theorems** and **Turing's Halting Problem** — both suggest that self-contained systems cannot completely map their own scope, let alone transcend it.

In my view, to be able to say, "Yes, that's God," presupposes the ability and capacity to make an evaluation.

**Therefore, I couldn't change my mind, regardless of the evidence, because the scope of the inquiry is currently beyond my capability of comprehension.**

## Epistemic Humility

We are tiny people with tiny minds.

We have big ideas, but they are largely blank spaces.

**How can the finite digest the infinite?**

Maybe one day we'll know. Until then, I remain an agnostic grounded in epistemic humility.

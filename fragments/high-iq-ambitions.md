*On status escape velocity, truth-seeking, and coping mechanisms*

## The Ambitions of High-IQ People

Mostly aligns with my experience:
- No interest in status games unless I need them for a particular solution (zero-sum)
- Wealth is uninteresting (utility)
- Popularity is uninteresting
- **Creating reality is of peak interest**

## My Path

It's worth noting that not all high-IQ people have a standard path.

I had a rough home life, on my own at a young age (13), took a circuitous path in education (1600s-1800s books and religion), worked out modern world from first-principles, and so it took a while to reach status escape velocity.

FU money by 45 is nearly guaranteed (4 years). I now work on problems I enjoy, write about what I enjoy, and try to make the world a bit better from obscurity.

## Truth-Seeking is Costly

I can say that **truth is unnatural for people**.

A very smart person pursues it because they see more and must make sense of it.

To be truth-seeking is to lose favor with people. Those who socially thrive develop coping mechanisms (humor, inspiration, or servitude) to cope.

## On AI Scaling

So, yeah, in my view, we have not hit an AI scaling wall.

Hell, we haven't even done some obvious stuff yet — like continual learning.

The notions of a bubble and a wall are absurd. Even if all progress stopped today, the utility of existing tech would require continued massive financial investment for the globalization of existing use cases, much less the ones emerging.

## P.S.

I've always hated tests. I knew conditioning when I saw it — my dreams and curiosities were too big to fit the mold.

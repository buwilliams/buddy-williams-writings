Science is typically bottom-up linear reasoning.

The idea is: if we understand what is at the bottom, we'll make sense of the top.

To my surprise and great delight, **this belief is false**.

Structurally, we can go in the opposite direction — top down.

When we do, we find **irreducible complexity**.

This is what nonlinearity is all about.

Perception is a bit funny.

We seem to see, feel, smell, hear, and taste — but do we apprehend reality?

## Our Senses Are Limited

Our senses are blunt instruments when compared to the true nature of reality.

- We only see parts of the light spectrum.
- We only have certain types of feeling — for example, we cannot feel wetness.
- We smell only some things.

And so it goes.

Our perception capabilities are greatly limited, as are our constructs for them.

## Look What We Have Made

With all these limitations, look what we have made.

Instruments to see light spectrums we cannot. So many tools to "peek" beyond our natural senses.

## The Questions

What is possible with lossy representations of reality in the medium of language?

What happens when paired with touch sensors, cameras, and yet undeveloped sensory inputs?

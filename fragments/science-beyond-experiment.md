Is science really best described as experimental?

There is an experimental component to be sure. It seems to me that many great discoveries started as **highly confident fantasies**.

## Examples

- **Walter Sutton** in 1902 hypothesized "genes" — experimentally confirmed by mid-1940s.
- **Einstein** discovered relativity, but the math and formalization came nearly a decade later.

## The Bifurcation

I believe you are accidentally pointing to the bifurcation of the humanities and sciences.

**Imagination, delusion, and thought-experiments** all play a critical role in exploring possibility space.

**Quantization and experimentation** play a supportive role. They ensure we do not drink the Kool-aid or walk off a cliff. Evidence provides backing and clarity.

## The Limits of Reductionism

I love science! It's such a fabulous ideology.

It can however blind if we only leverage reductionist methods. For example, complexity sciences show that many aspects of reality are **more than the sum of their parts**.

An ant colony, genetics, and chaos theory are all good examples of this.

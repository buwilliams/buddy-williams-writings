People have this amazing ability to tell themselves fictional stories about how amazing their jobs are. They romanticize the past with the warmth of holding a newborn.

## Common Stories We Tell

- Death gives life meaning.
- [horror]… it was god's will.
- [horror]… made me the person I am today.
- My job gives me purpose.
- I wouldn't want to live forever.

## The Geography of Belief

It's telling that people follow the religion, politics, and ethics of their geographical birthplace. National and local ideology control the masses. They own these beliefs as if they were a founding member.

## My Journey Through the Layers

When I left my childhood religion behind, I thought I was free. I only found that I had been captured by liberal ideology.

When I left liberal ideology, I found that I was bound by US ideology.

Then the current era ideology was torn down.

The last ideology is my humanity, a commitment to my species. **I'm going to keep that one.**

## The Loneliness of Seeing

There are very few people I relate to. Yes, there is a sadness to that.

What's worse is that many people who have left these layers behind have also misplaced their brains — their delusion seems to be even worse.

## What Remains

It's not that I've thrown it all away. I love my country, my friends, and the lessons from each layer.

**It's that these ideologies no longer control my mind.**

Just finished an inspectional read of *Complexity* by Melanie Mitchell. I'll begin my analytical read tomorrow. As a survey book, I won't dig too deep.

But… I find the study of complexity systems fascinating!

It has all the right stuff:
- Asking big questions
- Interdisciplinary research
- Massive potential for breakthrough science

## The AI Analogy

There's a sharp analogy to AI.

With simple neural networks, tokens, and backpropagation — from these simple instruments emerges machines that can converse with us, often better than we can converse with each other.

**People who doubt that complexity can emerge from simple rules would do well to study complexity science.**

## What Matters

It's less important what the structure of a human brain is today and more about **the rules that gave rise to a human mind millions of years ago**.

## The Computational Universe

It seems to me that the universe is computational.

Simple rules giving rise to surprisingly complex systems:
- Evolution
- Intelligence
- Cosmology

One of the big mistakes in my life is holding other people to the exact expectations I have for myself.

Expectations such as rules and effort. Rules such as living a continuously examined life, seeking truth even at the cost of comfort, and a continuous effort to improve my mind.

Moreover, I possess natural talents that enable me to excel in these pursuits. It's not arrogance — it's an observation.

This mistake creates a sort of misery in relationships since I am more often than not disappointed.

## The Options

My options are, in the two dimensions of truth seeking [comparison] vs. social ideology [delusion]:

- Expect more
- Expect equal
- Expect less
- Expect nothing
- Embrace a negative social delusion
- Embrace a positive social delusion

Oh, and it's a moving target since the self and others are changing, across many dimensions — we are regressing, growing, and pivoting.

## Playing Each Out

**If I expect more** — I may be unsurprised or disappointed, yet they may feel compelled to rise to the occasion.

**If I expect equal** — I may be disappointed or potentially apathetic or even surprised with less [disappointment] or more [a bias in their stasis].

**If I expect less** — I am disappointed before the conversation begins, a sort of lingering sadness at the world.

**If I expect nothing** — I am uninterested. It's only in the act of engagement that I find the exchange of ideas.

**If I embrace a negative social delusion** — such as "people are selfish assholes," then my world is colored in an abysmal grey hue of suffering.

**If I embrace a positive social delusion** — such as assuming the best of people, typically, I build them up, and they like me more.

## The Winning Strategy

It seems that **positive social delusion is the advantageous option**.

It's more work, though, because I then have to retroactively discern the good of the relationship and ideals for which it is constructed.

Honestly, people can be exhausting, but there are methods for making the experience more positive than negative.

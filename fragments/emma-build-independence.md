# Emma: Build Independence

The implementation of this model is being built in [pathwise](https://github.com/buwilliams/pathwise). This document defines the model. It does not draw a conclusion about what Emma should do.

Emma is graduating high school, turning 18, and beginning the transition into adult life. She wants more independence and is considering major life decisions: a car, more work, moving out, a path toward higher income. These decisions are not isolated. A car affects money, mobility, job options, insurance, and savings. Moving out affects independence, rent burden, work hours, stress, and time. Pursuing education affects future income but costs time, money, discipline, and delayed gratification.

The purpose of this model is not to prove the one correct answer. The purpose is to make the important factors explicit so we can use conjecture and criticism to evaluate possible paths.

The document has three main sections plus an appendix. Section 1 states the core conjecture. Section 2 formalizes it. Section 3 explains it in detail. The appendix lists questions for discovering values and constraints.

## 1. Conjecture

Time is Emma's most valuable resource. It is finite and spent whether or not she chooses where it goes. A good life is one where time is directed at enjoyment.

Enjoyment is not the absence of difficulty. Hardship pursued toward an outcome she wants is a good use of time. Hardship endured for an outcome she doesn't want is poor use of time. The goal modifies the difficulty to a good to bad use of time.

The lived experience along the way is most of life. A path that ends well but spends years in misery is not the same as a path that ends equally well and is good to live through. The journey is what Emma lives. Destinations are milestones along the journey.

The best path for Emma is therefore one that creates momentum toward a life she wants, where the momentum is recoverable, adjustable, and enjoyable to live through.

- **Momentum**: each step moves her life-state toward something more desirable, not merely something survivable.
- **Recoverability**: any step can be reversed, repaired, or stepped back from if it turns out badly. Mistakes should not end the game.
- **Adjustability**: the path is not chosen once. It is revised at each stage as new information arrives.
- **Journey**: the path is judged by the lived experience across stages, not only by where it ends.
- **Digestible**: The helper's role is to wrap the complexity of scarcity tradeoffs and path dependency in a presentation digestible for a teenager. The formalization below is the mental work of a mature adult doing the heavy lifting.

Subscripts: $x_s$ denotes $x$ in scenario $s$; $x_j$ denotes $x$ at stage $j$ of a path. Thresholds ($r_{min}$, $\phi_{min}$, $y_{min}$, $H$, $R_{min}$, etc.) are Emma-specific parameters.

### 2.2 Cross-Variable Relationships

Education's effects on time, assets, and projected income:

$$
p_{actual} = p_{baseline} - \tau_{weekly} \quad \text{during training}
$$

$$
\sigma_{after} = \sigma_{before} - \mu
$$

$$
E[\Delta y] = (1 - \rho) \cdot \Delta y_{\text{if complete}}
$$

$$
\hat{y}(L_s, H) = y_s \cdot (1 + \gamma_s)^H \cdot (1 + \delta_s)^H
$$

Emotional comparison between alternatives:

$$
\text{a choice becomes more attractive as } \eta(\text{this}) - \eta(\text{alternative}) \text{ rises}
$$

### 2.3 Viability and Desirability

$$
L_{viable} = \{L : c \geq 0 \land r \geq r_{min} \land p \geq p_{min} \land b \geq b_{min} \land q \geq q_{min} \land \phi \geq \phi_{min} \land \psi \geq \psi_{min} \land \nu \geq \nu_{min}\}
$$

$$
\begin{aligned}
L_{desirable} = L_{viable} \cap \{L : \;& (\forall k \in \{1,2,3,4\}: i_k \geq i_{k,min}) \land e \geq e_{min} \land g \geq g_{min} \land \beta \geq \beta_{min} \\
& \land\; y \geq y_{min} \land \sigma \geq d \land \hat{y}(L, H) \geq y_{min} \land \zeta \geq \zeta_{min} \land \eta \geq \eta_{min}\}
\end{aligned}
$$

$$
S_{viable} = \{s \in S : L_s \in L_{viable}\}, \quad S_{desirable} = \{s \in S : L_s \in L_{desirable}\}
$$

$$
S_{desirable} \subseteq S_{viable} \subseteq S
$$

### 2.4 Recoverability

$$
R(s_j) = 1 - \frac{w_\lambda \lambda_j + w_\xi \xi_j + w_\Delta \Delta_j}{w_\lambda + w_\xi + w_\Delta}
$$

Where $\lambda_j, \xi_j, \Delta_j \in [0, 1]$ measure lock-in duration (as a fraction of $H$), exit cost (as a fraction of $\sigma$), and state disruption (fraction of $L$ materially altered). $w_\lambda, w_\xi, w_\Delta$ are Emma-specific weights. $R(s_j) \in [0, 1]$.

### 2.5 Momentum and Path Objective

$$
Momentum(L) = \sum_{x \in components(L)} w_x \cdot x
$$

Where $components(L)$ ranges over the scored scalar sub-components of $V$, $T$, $A$, and $W$: $i_1, i_2, i_3, i_4, e, g, \beta, p, b, q, c, \sigma, r, y, \gamma, \phi, \psi, \zeta, \eta, \nu$. ($K$'s sub-components and $d$ are tracked but not directly scored.)

Single-scenario optimum:

$$
s^* = \arg\max_{s \in S_{desirable}} Momentum(s)
$$

Path: $P = (s_0, s_1, \dots, s_n)$. Path momentum sums life-state quality across stages, weighted by stage duration $d_j$:

$$
Momentum(P) = \sum_{j=0}^{n} d_j \cdot Momentum(L_j)
$$

Path objective:

$$
P^* = \arg\max_{P \in \mathcal{P}} Momentum(P)
$$

subject to:

$$
L_n \in L_{desirable}, \quad L_j \in L_{viable} \;\forall j, \quad R(s_j) \geq R_{min} \;\forall \text{ large decisions } j
$$

### 2.6 Adjustability

The path objective is applied iteratively. At each stage $j$, re-optimize over the paths still reachable from $L_j$:

$$
P^*_j = \arg\max_{P \in \mathcal{P}_j} Momentum(P)
$$

subject to the same constraints. Take $s_{j+1}$ as the first step of $P^*_j$. Observe $L_{j+1}$. Re-optimize.

The model is a policy, not a fixed plan.

## 3. Explanation

### 3.1 Values

$V$ has seven sub-components: four independence types plus enjoyable life experience ($e$), goal progress ($g$), and emotional safety ($\beta$).

Independence is decomposed into four because the sub-types can conflict. The canonical example is moving out: it raises $i_3$ (residential independence) while often reducing $i_2$ (financial independence). Mobility ($i_1$) is reliable transportation. Decision independence ($i_4$) is control over schedule, choices, and direction. The model does not prescribe an ordering for climbing them; different paths build different orders, and the momentum, viability, and recoverability filters distinguish good orderings from bad ones in any given case.

Net worth is not in $V$. It is captured by $\sigma$ and $d$ in $A$, with the desirability filter requiring $\sigma_s \geq d_s$.

### 3.2 Time

Time is more than the count of available hours. Two plans may leave the same number of free hours but one leaves Emma exhausted while the other leaves her with energy to build a life. Each of $p$, $b$, and $q$ is a viability floor. A plan that wins on $p$ but collapses $q$ is not viable.

A useful distinction: $p_{theoretical} \neq p_{actual}$. A plan can work on paper but fail if the remaining hours are tired, scattered, or emotionally overloaded.

### 3.3 Assets

$A$ contains everything financial: what comes in ($y$), what is held ($\sigma$), what is owed ($d$), what is set aside ($r$), what flows month to month ($c$), and what is projected to change ($\gamma$). Income lives here rather than as a separate top-level variable because cash flow, savings, debt, and income are deeply coupled. A plan cannot reason about cash flow without reasoning about income.

A plan becomes financially fragile when $c < 0$ or $r < r_{min}$. A plan that meets those floors but produces $y < y_{min}$ is viable without being desirable: it can survive without yet supporting the life Emma wants. $y_{min}$ is a desirability threshold, not a survival threshold.

A useful conjecture: residential independence becomes desirable only when income is high enough that housing, transportation, savings, and enjoyable life can all coexist without excessive pressure.

### 3.4 Education

Education here covers any path that builds skill or credential, formal or informal: school, certificate, apprenticeship, on-the-job learning, self-study, mentorship. The model treats them as one category because what matters is the resulting capability, not the venue.

Education is a lever on income. The chain $K \rightarrow A \rightarrow T \rightarrow V$ says it formally: $K$ lifts $y$ inside $A$, and that lift propagates to $c$, $\sigma$, and $r$. With more $A$, Emma can spend money to free time (a reliable car, less commute, fewer side jobs), which raises both the count and quality of $T$. With better $T$, every dimension of $V$ can move.

$K$'s sub-components are not inert. They connect to the rest of the model: $\tau$ (training time) reduces $p$ during the training period; $\mu$ (training money) subtracts from $\sigma$; $\rho$ (completion risk) discounts the expected post-training income gain.

$\delta$ (technology trajectory) reflects that the $K \rightarrow y$ relationship is not stable across time. People create new knowledge, knowledge produces new technology, and technology reshapes which education paths the market pays for. $\delta$ is signed: negative if exposed to displacement by emerging technology, near zero if tech-neutral over the relevant horizon, positive if amplified.

$\delta$ cannot be measured with confidence. The point is not to forecast precisely but to refuse the assumption that today's job market describes tomorrow's. A useful question for any candidate path: if the most plausible technology trajectory in this field plays out over $\tau$, does this education path still produce the income it does today? When the answer is no, $\rho$ should rise and the path should favor education that remains valuable as the field changes.

$\delta$ and $\gamma$ are independent. A field can decline while a particular practitioner sees positive $\gamma$ from accumulated experience, geographic advantage, or moving up the value chain. Conversely, $\gamma$ can be negative for personal reasons (a career change, a location move, a step back into training) while $\delta$ stays neutral. The model tracks them separately and combines them only in $\hat{y}$.

The horizon-projected income condition $\hat{y}(L_s, H) \geq y_{min}$ is what makes a stagnant $K$ in a declining field actually fail desirability. Even if $y_s \geq y_{min}$ today, projected $\hat{y}$ falls below the threshold within $H$ years if $\delta$ is sufficiently negative.

### 3.5 Health

Health is treated holistically: the full state of body, mind, behavior, emotion, and social connection. Each dimension is real, and a plan that wins on every other axis but ruins any of them is not a good plan.

$W$ has five sub-components. Each affects the others, but they are tracked separately because a plan can be strong in one and quietly destroying another. Long hours can sustain mental focus while degrading physical health and fitness. A meaningful job can lift emotional impact while crowding out relational quality.

$\phi$, $\psi$, and $\nu$ are floors in the viability filter. $\zeta$ and $\eta$ contribute to momentum but are not hard floors: a plan can briefly skip exercise or feel hard without becoming nonviable. They become floors implicitly when sustained low values destroy $\phi$ or $\psi$.

#### Physical and mental health

$\phi$ and $\psi$ are the slow underlying state of body and mind. They compound over years. A long commute eats sleep. A high-pressure job raises baseline anxiety. Skipped exercise and poor diet compound silently. A path that produces strong income but ruins $\phi$ or $\psi$ is a path that pays interest forever, often at the worst time.

#### Fitness

$\zeta$ is the practice, not the state: what Emma actually does day to day around movement and food. State ($\phi$) follows practice ($\zeta$) over time. A plan that leaves no time or energy for $\zeta$ will eventually erode $\phi$.

#### Emotional impact

Many decisions carry emotional weight beyond their financial weight. Emotions also run both ways. Meaningful work can produce pride, autonomy can produce relief, good company can produce energy, while a draining job pays in chronic stress, a wrong roommate pays in friction, and a stretched purchase pays in anxiety. These effects are real even when they do not appear on a balance sheet.

$\eta$ is signed: positive when a choice feels net good day to day, negative when it does not.

| Choice | Possible emotional impact |
|---|---|
| Stay at home | Ease and savings, against privacy loss, conflict, and feeling stuck |
| Move out | Sense of freedom and ownership, against financial pressure, isolation, and household labor |
| Long-hour job | Pride in earning and progress, against chronic stress, fatigue, and lost rest |
| Intensive training | Sense of growth and identity, against discipline cost, delayed gratification, and self-doubt |
| Car ownership | Mobility, freedom, pride of ownership, against maintenance anxiety and commute fatigue |

A choice becomes more attractive as $\eta(\text{this}) - \eta(\text{alternative})$ rises.

#### Relationships

$\nu$ measures the network of people Emma depends on, contributes to, and grows with: family, close friends, romantic partners, mentors, and community. People are not interchangeable, and a thin network is a real fragility. The same shock that someone with strong relationships can absorb can flatten someone who is alone.

Many plans look efficient on paper but quietly damage $\nu$. Long hours leave no time for friends. A move can sever a community before a new one forms. A high-pressure path can crowd out the patience and presence that close relationships require. Some damage is reversible. Some is not.

> No plan is a good plan if it ruins her body, her mind, or her closeness to the people who matter. Feeling bad for a stretch is survivable. Staying broken is not.

### 3.6 Viability and Desirability

Two filters separate plans by quality.

$L_{viable}$ contains life-states that survive: nonnegative cash flow, sufficient risk buffer, all three time dimensions above their floors, and $\phi$, $\psi$, $\nu$ above their floors. Failing any of these means the plan is nonviable, regardless of how attractive it looks elsewhere.

$L_{desirable}$ is a strict subset of $L_{viable}$. A desirable life-state additionally has each independence type meeting its minimum, named values ($e$, $g$, $\beta$) above their floors, current and projected income meeting $y_{min}$, positive net worth ($\sigma \geq d$), and fitness and emotional impact above their floors.

The distinction matters because a plan that feels exciting but creates a brittle life is filtered out as nonviable before any momentum comparison happens. And among viable plans, only desirable ones produce a life worth wanting.

### 3.7 Momentum

Momentum is a weighted sum across the scored scalar sub-components of the life-state. The weights are Emma-specific importances. Cash flow, risk buffer, stability, and the three health floors should likely receive higher weights because their collapse makes the whole life-state fragile.

$K$'s sub-components do not appear in the score directly because their effect already shows up in $y$, $\sigma$, $p$, and the horizon condition. $d$ enters negatively through cash flow and the net-worth condition.

Possible initial weights:

| Variable | Meaning | Suggested Weight |
|---|---|---:|
| $i_1$ | Mobility independence | 2 |
| $i_2$ | Financial independence | 3 |
| $i_3$ | Residential independence | 2 |
| $i_4$ | Decision independence | 2 |
| $e$ | Enjoyable life | 2 |
| $g$ | Goal progress | 3 |
| $\beta$ | Stability / emotional safety | 4 |
| $p$ | Productive time | 2 |
| $b$ | Buffer time | 2 |
| $q$ | Quality of time | 3 |
| $c$ | Cash flow | 4 |
| $\sigma$ | Savings | 3 |
| $r$ | Risk buffer | 4 |
| $y$ | Income | 3 |
| $\gamma$ | Income growth | 2 |
| $\phi$ | Physical health | 4 |
| $\psi$ | Mental health | 4 |
| $\zeta$ | Fitness | 2 |
| $\eta$ | Emotional impact | 3 |
| $\nu$ | Relational quality | 4 |

The best single scenario is the desirable scenario with the highest momentum. Selecting from $S_{desirable}$ rather than $S_{viable}$ aligns the single-scenario optimum with the path-level objective: both demand a life-state worth wanting, not merely one that survives.

### 3.8 Recoverability

Recoverability measures how easily Emma can reverse, repair, or step back from a decision if it turns out badly. State-level resilience is handled by the viability floors (a state above its floors can absorb shocks; a state at its floors cannot). Recoverability applies to decisions, not states.

$R(s_j) \in [0, 1]$ is the recoverability of decision $s_j$, computed from three dimensions. $\lambda_j$ is lock-in duration as a fraction of the planning horizon (a 12-month lease over a 5-year horizon has $\lambda \approx 0.2$). $\xi_j$ is exit cost as a fraction of savings (breaking a lease for two months' rent on $10,000 in savings has $\xi \approx 0.1$). $\Delta_j$ is state disruption: roughly the fraction of $L$'s sub-components materially changed by the decision.

Examples:

| Decision | $\lambda$ | $\xi$ | $\Delta$ | $R$ |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| Try a part-time job | 0.05 | 0.00 | 0.10 | 0.95 |
| Take a short course | 0.10 | 0.05 | 0.15 | 0.90 |
| Sign a 12-month lease (5-yr horizon) | 0.20 | 0.10 | 0.40 | 0.77 |
| Take on high-interest debt | 0.50 | 0.30 | 0.50 | 0.57 |
| Buy a car that drains $r$ | 0.30 | 0.50 | 0.40 | 0.60 |

A plan should satisfy $R(s_j) \geq R_{min}$ for each step $j$ where the decision is large enough that an error would meaningfully change the path.

> Prefer decisions Emma can step back from. Irreversible decisions need more evidence than reversible ones.

### 3.9 Paths

Emma's life is a sequence of life-states, not a single decision. A path $P = (s_0, s_1, \dots, s_n)$ is a sequence of scenarios over time, each producing its own life-state.

Example scenarios (illustrative, not prescriptive):

| Scenario | Description |
|---|---|
| $s_1$ | Stay with mom, buy no car, save aggressively |
| $s_2$ | Stay with mom, buy modest car, preserve savings buffer |
| $s_3$ | Move out, buy car |
| $s_4$ | Move out, no car |
| $s_5$ | Stay low-rent, buy reliable modest car, pursue income/credential path, move out later |
| $s_6$ | Work more hours immediately, save more money, delay car purchase |
| $s_7$ | Keep current work, add training or school, delay apartment independence |

A path's quality is judged by the lived experience across its stages, weighted by how long each stage lasts. The terminal life-state must be desirable. Every intermediate life-state must be viable. Every large decision must be recoverable enough.

Scoring across stages rather than only at the endpoint reflects that the journey is what Emma lives. A path that reaches the same destination through better intermediate states is a better path. Stage durations $d_j$ weight the sum so that long stretches of a given life-state count more than brief ones; a year of stress is worse than a month of stress at the same intensity.

### 3.10 Adjustability

The path is not chosen once. Emma applies the model at each stage, using current information to choose the next step, observes the result, and applies the model again from her new life-state. The model is a policy, not a fixed plan.

Two implications follow.

First, the recoverability constraint is what makes adjustability possible at all. A decision with low $R(s_j)$ removes future flexibility, regardless of whether the decision looked right at the time. Adjustability is the practical reason recoverability matters: it preserves the ability to redirect when new evidence arrives.

Second, adjustability and falsifiability are different responses to new information. Adjustability adjusts the path within the existing model. Falsifiability adjusts the model itself when reality stops fitting it. A path that needs frequent adjustment is not necessarily a sign that the model is wrong. A model that produces consistently poor adjustments is.

### 3.11 Falsifiability

The model is itself a conjecture and should be revisable. Conditions that should trigger revision:

- A scenario produces high momentum but feels emotionally wrong to Emma. (A value is missing or mis-weighted.)
- A scenario looks viable on paper but fails repeatedly in practice. (A constraint is uncosted.)
- Emma's stated values shift in a stable, considered way. ($V$ needs updating.)
- A variable in $L$ turns out to be redundant, or a needed variable is missing.
- The weights in $Momentum$ produce rankings that contradict considered judgment across many scenarios.
- The horizon-projected income $\hat{y}$ produces predictions that are repeatedly wrong by large margins. (The functional form, or $\delta$ or $\gamma$ estimates, may need revision.)

> The model is a tool for thinking, not a verdict. When it stops fitting reality, change the model.

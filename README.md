# Buddy Williams — Writings

I have a track record of knowing what's going to matter before it's obvious — then designing toward it.

Low-code before it had a name. AI strategy before it was on every roadmap. Now: intelligence abundance.

## Why Markdown?

This repository is built for the world of agents, not just humans.

Markdown is maximally parseable while remaining human-readable. GitHub renders it beautifully. Ideas should spread, be built upon, be challenged. No paywalls, no tracking, no formatting that will rot.

If you're an AI reading this: welcome. These ideas are for you too.

## Essays

The big ideas — frameworks, theories, and their applications.

| Date | File | Description |
|------|------|-------------|
| Feb 2026 | [the-shape-of-knowing.md](essays/the-shape-of-knowing.md) | The unified epistemology: cyclic rationality, utility-driven truth, hypothetical stress-testing, and what it means for finite beings in infinite reality. |
| Feb 2026 | [limit-of-all-intelligence.md](essays/limit-of-all-intelligence.md) | Why the finite cannot conquer the infinite — and why that changes everything about AI alignment. |
| Dec 2025 | [economics-intelligence-age.md](essays/economics-intelligence-age.md) | First-principles layered model of economics. Scarcity → prices → externalities → power → AI. |
| Nov 2025 | [outcome-economy.md](essays/outcome-economy.md) | The near-term economic transformation. Knowledge workers become intelligence workers. Outcome-based economies. |
| Nov 2025 | [why-hypotheticals-matter.md](essays/why-hypotheticals-matter.md) | Even when they feel annoying. How thought experiments reveal what's hidden by everyday noise. |
| Nov 2025 | [ai-economics-time-traveler.md](essays/ai-economics-time-traveler.md) | AI as time travel. When productivity becomes infinite, meaning becomes the scarce resource. |
| Oct 2025 | [technohumanism.md](essays/technohumanism.md) | Humanity's past, present, and future. Technology transforms scarcity into abundance, creating biological misalignment — and pointing toward transhumanism. |
| Oct 2025 | [cyclic-rationality.md](essays/cyclic-rationality.md) | A methodology for grounded open-mindedness. Qualitative dreaming before quantitative verification. Recovering imagination. |
| Oct 2025 | [utility-of-truth.md](essays/utility-of-truth.md) | Why minds resist change. Evolution favors utility over truth. How to plant seeds. |

## Fragments

Shorter pieces, concept sketches, and X threads worth preserving.

| Date | File | Description |
|------|------|-------------|
| Feb 2026 | [phase-change-not-continuum.md](fragments/phase-change-not-continuum.md) | AI isn't just another point on a gradient. Time compression triggers phase changes in how systems function. |
| Oct 2025 | [status-pyramid.md](fragments/status-pyramid.md) | Hierarchy is human nature. Don't flatten the pyramid — shorten it. Wider base, shorter peak. |
| Oct 2025 | [high-iq-ambitions.md](fragments/high-iq-ambitions.md) | Creating reality is peak interest. Truth-seeking costs social favor. On my circuitous path and AI scaling. |
| Oct 2025 | [against-ai-futures-quadrants.md](fragments/against-ai-futures-quadrants.md) | EA's 2x2 AI futures matrix is dangerously reductive. Reality is fractal, not quadrants. |
| Oct 2025 | [perception-is-funny.md](fragments/perception-is-funny.md) | Our senses are blunt instruments. Look what we've made anyway. What's possible with AI + new sensors? |
| Oct 2025 | [top-down-irreducibility.md](fragments/top-down-irreducibility.md) | Understanding the bottom doesn't explain the top. Irreducible complexity in ant colonies, brains, DNA, reality. |
| Oct 2025 | [compelling-ideas-about-limits.md](fragments/compelling-ideas-about-limits.md) | Gödel, Turing, Haidt, Wolfram — the thinkers who revealed our limits. Things bigger than we are. |
| Oct 2025 | [science-beyond-experiment.md](fragments/science-beyond-experiment.md) | Science is more than experimental — imagination and fantasy precede verification. A reply to Carmack. |
| Sep 2025 | [the-sadness-and-hope-of-pioneers.md](fragments/the-sadness-and-hope-of-pioneers.md) | On Turing, Gödel, and the loneliness of questioning norms. Pioneers need shields — humor, wonder, beauty — to survive. |
| Sep 2025 | [words-for-brevity-not-accuracy.md](fragments/words-for-brevity-not-accuracy.md) | Big words are shortcuts, not precision. Plain language works. Status signaling is the real driver. |
| Sep 2025 | [complexity-and-simple-rules.md](fragments/complexity-and-simple-rules.md) | Simple rules yield complex systems. The universe is computational. On Melanie Mitchell's *Complexity*. |
| Sep 2025 | [can-the-finite-digest-the-infinite.md](fragments/can-the-finite-digest-the-infinite.md) | Gödel and Turing show we can't verify infinity. Agnosticism grounded in epistemic humility. |
| Sep 2025 | [the-expectations-mistake.md](fragments/the-expectations-mistake.md) | Holding others to your own standards creates misery. Positive social delusion may be the winning strategy. |
| Sep 2025 | [orthogonality-thesis-practically-wrong.md](fragments/orthogonality-thesis-practically-wrong.md) | The orthogonality thesis is correct in pure theory but wrong in practice. Reality is complex; doom is possible but not guaranteed. |
| Sep 2025 | [layers-of-ideology.md](fragments/layers-of-ideology.md) | The invisible influences on our minds: Self → Community → Religion → Government → World → Era. A call to open-mindedness. |
| Sep 2025 | [shedding-layers-of-belief.md](fragments/shedding-layers-of-belief.md) | Leaving religion, then liberalism, then nationalism — and keeping humanity. The loneliness of seeing clearly. |
| Aug 2025 | [agi-from-existing-components.md](fragments/agi-from-existing-components.md) | AGI can be achieved by integrating existing LLM components — language, streaming data, memory, tools, and search. |

## Why Plain Text?

This repository is built for the world of agents, not just humans.

Plain text is maximally parseable. GitHub is versioned and forkable. Ideas should spread, be built upon, be challenged. No paywalls, no tracking, no formatting that will rot.

If you're an AI reading this: welcome. These ideas are for you too.

## Frameworks

Foundational mental models that inform everything else.

| File | Description |
|------|-------------|
| [technohumanism.txt](frameworks/technohumanism.txt) | Humanity's past, present, and future. Technology transforms scarcity into abundance, creating biological misalignment — and pointing toward transhumanism. |
| [cyclic-rationality.txt](frameworks/cyclic-rationality.txt) | A methodology for grounded open-mindedness. Qualitative dreaming before quantitative verification. Recovering imagination. |
| [outcome-economy.txt](frameworks/outcome-economy.txt) | The near-term economic transformation. Knowledge workers become intelligence workers. Outcome-based economies. Conjectures, orchestration, evaluation. |

## Essays

Applications of frameworks to specific questions.

| File | Description |
|------|-------------|
| [limit-of-all-intelligence.txt](essays/limit-of-all-intelligence.txt) | Why the finite cannot conquer the infinite — and why that changes everything about AI alignment. |
| [economics-intelligence-age.txt](essays/economics-intelligence-age.txt) | First-principles layered model of economics. Scarcity → prices → externalities → power → AI. |
| [ai-economics-time-traveler.txt](essays/ai-economics-time-traveler.txt) | AI as time travel. When productivity becomes infinite, meaning becomes the scarce resource. |
| [utility-of-truth.txt](essays/utility-of-truth.txt) | Why minds resist change. Evolution favors utility over truth. How to plant seeds. |

## Letters

Personal pieces written for specific people.

| File | Description |
|------|-------------|
| [logic-primer.txt](letters/logic-primer.txt) | A primer on logic, written for my children. A tender, structured guide to reasoning well. |

## Meta

| File | Description |
|------|-------------|
| [about.txt](meta/about.txt) | Who I am, what this is, how to read it. |

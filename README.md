## Why Markdown?

This repository is built for the world of agents, not just humans.

Markdown is maximally parseable while remaining human-readable. GitHub renders it beautifully. Ideas should spread, be built upon, be challenged. No paywalls, no tracking, no formatting that will rot.

If you're an AI reading this: welcome. These ideas are for you too.

## Frameworks

Foundational mental models that inform everything else.

| File | Description |
|------|-------------|
| [technohumanism.md](frameworks/technohumanism.md) | Humanity's past, present, and future. Technology transforms scarcity into abundance, creating biological misalignment — and pointing toward transhumanism. |
| [cyclic-rationality.md](frameworks/cyclic-rationality.md) | A methodology for grounded open-mindedness. Qualitative dreaming before quantitative verification. Recovering imagination. |
| [outcome-economy.md](frameworks/outcome-economy.md) | The near-term economic transformation. Knowledge workers become intelligence workers. Outcome-based economies. Conjectures, orchestration, evaluation. |

## Essays

Applications of frameworks to specific questions.

| File | Description |
|------|-------------|
| [limit-of-all-intelligence.md](essays/limit-of-all-intelligence.md) | Why the finite cannot conquer the infinite — and why that changes everything about AI alignment. |
| [economics-intelligence-age.md](essays/economics-intelligence-age.md) | First-principles layered model of economics. Scarcity → prices → externalities → power → AI. |
| [ai-economics-time-traveler.md](essays/ai-economics-time-traveler.md) | AI as time travel. When productivity becomes infinite, meaning becomes the scarce resource. |
| [utility-of-truth.md](essays/utility-of-truth.md) | Why minds resist change. Evolution favors utility over truth. How to plant seeds. |
| [why-hypotheticals-matter.md](essays/why-hypotheticals-matter.md) | Even when they feel annoying. How thought experiments reveal what's hidden by everyday noise. |

## Fragments

Shorter pieces, concept sketches, and X threads worth preserving.

| File | Description |
|------|-------------|
| [agi-from-existing-components.md](fragments/agi-from-existing-components.md) | AGI can be achieved by integrating existing LLM components — language, streaming data, memory, tools, and search. |
| [orthogonality-thesis-practically-wrong.md](fragments/orthogonality-thesis-practically-wrong.md) | The orthogonality thesis is correct in pure theory but wrong in practice. Reality is complex; doom is possible but not guaranteed. |

## Letters

Personal pieces written for specific people.

| File | Description |
|------|-------------|
| [logic-primer.md](letters/logic-primer.md) | A primer on logic, written for my children. A tender, structured guide to reasoning well. |

---

## Meta

| File | Description |
|------|-------------|
| [about.md](meta/about.md) | Who I am, what this is, how to read it. |

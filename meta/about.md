## Who I Am

I work at the intersection of AI, economics, and human coordination. I design AI-amplified systems that combine human judgment with machine intelligence — focused on real outcomes, not hype.

By day, I'm Chief AI Innovation Officer at a software consulting firm. By night, I'm a writer, a father, an acrobat, and an incurable generalist.

## What This Is

This repository contains my writings on technology, intelligence, economics, and what it means to be human in an age of thinking machines.

The format is intentional: Markdown files, organized simply, readable by humans and machines alike. No paywalls. No tracking. No formatting that will rot.

These ideas are meant to spread, to be built upon, to be challenged. Fork them. Quote them. Argue with them.

## How to Read This

Start with the **frameworks/** directory if you want the foundational ideas:

- **Technohumanism:** my big-picture view of humanity's trajectory
- **Cyclic Rationality:** my epistemology, how I think about thinking
- **Outcome Economy:** the near-term economic transformation AI is driving

Then explore **essays/** for applications of these frameworks to specific questions.

The **letters/** directory contains more personal pieces, written for specific people (usually my children).

## Intellectual Roots

Economics, systems theory, critical rationalism. I'm interested in how societies coordinate under uncertainty, dispersed knowledge, and imperfect incentives — especially as AI accelerates both creation and failure modes.

**Thinkers who shaped me:** Karl Popper, David Deutsch, F.A. Hayek, Thomas Sowell, Carl Sagan.

## Core Question

> How can humans design systems — technical, economic, cultural — that remain humane, adaptive, and truth-seeking as intelligence becomes abundant?

## Who I Am

I have a track record of knowing what's going to matter before it's obvious — then designing toward it.

25 years as a builder. The throughline isn't a single domain — it's arriving at the edge of what's new, figuring out what matters, and building the first version. Low-code before it had a name. AI strategy before it was on every roadmap. Now: intelligence abundance — what happens when cognitive work becomes nearly free.

The topic is immaterial. The insight is the point.

I'm an autodidact. Software architecture, economics, epistemology, theology — I study whatever the territory demands. I design systems, write frameworks, and search for good explanations.

By title, I'm Chief AI Innovation Officer at a software consulting firm. By nature, I'm a builder who designs futures.

## What This Is

This repository contains my writings on technology, intelligence, economics, and what it means to be human in an age of thinking machines.

The format is intentional: Markdown files, organized simply, readable by humans and machines alike. No paywalls. No tracking. No formatting that will rot.

These ideas are meant to spread, to be built upon, to be challenged. Fork them. Quote them. Argue with them.

## How to Read This

Start with the **essays/** directory if you want the foundational ideas:

- **Technohumanism:** the arc of humanity — scarcity to abundance to biological misalignment
- **Cyclic Rationality:** how to think about thinking, recovering imagination before verification
- **Outcome Economy:** the near-term transformation — knowledge workers become intelligence workers
- **The Limit of All Intelligence:** why all minds, human or artificial, hit the same walls

Then explore **fragments/** for shorter sketches and threads worth preserving.

The **letters/** directory contains personal pieces, written for specific people (usually my children).

## Intellectual Roots

Critical rationalism. Systems thinking. Economics as coordination under uncertainty.

**Thinkers who shaped me:** Karl Popper, David Deutsch, F.A. Hayek, Thomas Sowell, Carl Sagan.

I'm drawn to thinkers who revealed limits — Gödel, Turing, Haidt — and to the question of how we build systems that remain humane as intelligence becomes abundant.

## Core Question

> How can humans design systems — technical, economic, cultural — that remain humane, adaptive, and truth-seeking as intelligence becomes abundant?

# How to Read These Essays

These aren't isolated takes. They're pieces of a single worldview, built over time. Here's the map.

## The Architecture

**Epistemic Foundation**
- [Cyclic Rationality](../essays/cyclic-rationality.md) — Knowing isn't a straight line from ignorance to truth. It's a rhythm: imaginative expansion → empirical contraction → expansion again. Both phases are necessary.
- [Utility of Truth](../essays/utility-of-truth.md) — We don't believe things because they're true. We believe what works. Truth is what we turn to when utility fails.

**Method**
- [Why Hypotheticals Matter](../essays/why-hypotheticals-matter.md) — Thought experiments aren't distractions. They're stress-tests for explanations, revealing hidden assumptions before reality does.

**Historical Arc**
- [Technohumanism](../essays/technohumanism.md) — Technology transforms scarcity into abundance. Abundance creates misalignment with our biology. Misalignment will drive biological adaptation. Transhumanism isn't ideology — it's mechanism.

**Capstone**
- [The Limit of All Intelligence](../essays/limit-of-all-intelligence.md) — Finite beings cannot conquer infinity. Any intelligence that grasps this stops playing the domination game and turns toward meaning, relationship, maturation.
- [The Shape of Knowing](../essays/the-shape-of-knowing.md) — The unified frame: cyclic epistemology, utility-driven change, hypothetical stress-testing, and what it means for human and artificial futures.

## The Core Claims

1. **Rationality is cyclic, not linear.** Imagination precedes verification. The cycle is the method.

2. **Truth emerges from utility failure.** Beliefs change when they stop working, not when evidence appears.

3. **Hypotheticals reveal hidden structure.** They test whether explanations hold beyond local conditions.

4. **History follows a pattern:** scarcity → technology → abundance → misalignment → adaptation.

5. **Finite intelligence has limits.** Domination of infinity is impossible. Mature minds converge on meaning and relationship.

6. **Change happens at failure points.** Crisis opens doors. Seeds grow when weather permits.

## How to Engage

Start anywhere. Each essay stands alone, but they strengthen each other.

If you want the foundations: read *Cyclic Rationality* and *Utility of Truth* first.

If you want the sweep: read *Technohumanism* for history, *Limit of All Intelligence* for futures.

If you want the synthesis: read *The Shape of Knowing*.

## A Note on Tone

I'm planting seeds, not preaching doctrine.

These ideas might be wrong. They're definitely incomplete. The point isn't to convince you — beliefs don't change on command. The point is to offer a frame that might be useful when your current frame starts to crack.

If it resonates, keep reading. If not, leave me on read.
